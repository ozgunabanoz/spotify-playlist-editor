A tool for editing spotify playlists. Using React for client side and Express for server side. Authorization handled through passport's spotify strategy.

Currently has shuffling and sorting by BPM (ascending and descending order) functionalities. More to come.

Design is pretty basic right now. I am planning to make some progress on this issue in due time.
